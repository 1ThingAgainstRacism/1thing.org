        In April 2021, my journey to 1 Thing started with a basic presentation
        to document anti-Asian hate incidents, aiming to raise awareness among
        Google colleagues about the AAPI community's challenges. Unexpectedly,
        the presentation garnered attention within Google, leading others to
        contribute additional incidents, refine content, and share it widely. As
        a result, the presentation reached thousands of Googlers and was cited
        in numerous internal events and initiatives. I noticed that many AAPI
        community members, including myself, were upset about anti-Asian hate
        but seldom took action. Upon reflecting on my own inaction, I identified
        several excuses, such as feeling powerless, lacking time and resources,
        struggling to find suitable actions, being discouraged by the lack of
        results, and feeling isolated due to others' inactivity. The
        presentation experience shifted my perspective, motivating me to take
        manageable actions without fretting over immediate results and
        encouraging others to join me. I believed that if enough people became
        mobilized, real change would follow. This led me to establish the
        non-profit organization, 1 Thing Against Racism. 1 Thing's mission is to
        mobilize individuals and communities to take small actions against
        racism and hate, inspiring others to participate in the movement. By
        fostering a cycle of action, sharing, and inspiration, we aim to create
        a positive feedback loop that combines small efforts into a large social
        movement driving meaningful change. Using our volunteers' technological
        expertise, 1 Thing developed tools to help others embrace the 1 Thing
        concept. We transformed the anti-Asian hate incident presentation into
        the real-time tracking website hatecrimetracker.1thing.org. Upon
        analyzing incident data, we found many victims and families needed
        immediate assistance, so we established the anti-Asian hate victim
        support fund. Furthermore, volunteers are developing Together, a mobile
        app tailored for social and racial equality volunteers, enabling them to
        practice the 1 Thing idea and achieve their objectives.
