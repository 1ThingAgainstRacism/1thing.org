## 1thing.org
The 1Thing.org website is where visitors can get to know the organization. Here, they can read about who we are, what we do, why we do it, and how they can adopt and enact the core mission of the organization.

## Our Mission
Take Action. Share. Inspire.

These three simple statements embody the core mission of the organization and create, what we like to call, a cycle of action. The idea is that people who discover 1Thing will be inspired to take action against anti-Asian racism and share with others how they’re doing “one thing” to fight racism and prejudice, which will hopefully inspire others to do the same, and thus keep the cycle of action going.
